                    <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="join">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. 
                        Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span class="join">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
                    <h2><span class="join">What is Join?</span></h2>
                    <p><span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated 
                        students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br><br>
                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, 
                        limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="join">Join</span> leverages the principles of 
                        kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.<br><br>
                        It is important to note that <span class="join">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended 
                        for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience,

                    <h2><span class="join">How to use it</span></h2>
                    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join">Join</span>:</p>
                    <div class="help-how">
                        <h2><span class="dark-blue">1.</span></h2>
                        <p><span class="dark-blue">Exploring the Board</span> <br></span>
                            When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains 
                            four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="help-how">
                        <h2><span class="dark-blue">2.</span></h2>
                        <p><span class="dark-blue">Creating Contacts</span> <br></span>
                            In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
                            "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks
                            and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="help-how">
                        <h2><span class="dark-blue">3.</span></h2>
                        <p><span class="dark-blue">Adding Cards</span> <br></span>
                            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. 
                            Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card,
                            like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="help-how">
                        <h2><span class="dark-blue">4.</span></h2>
                        <p><span><span class="dark-blue">Moving Cards</span> <br></span>
                            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping 
                            the card from one list to another.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="help-how">
                        <h2><span class="dark-blue">5.</span></h2>
                        <p><span class="dark-blue">Deleting Cards</span> <br></span>
                            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will 
                            permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.<br><br>
                            Remember that using <span class="join">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the
                            board reflects the current state of your project.<br><br>
